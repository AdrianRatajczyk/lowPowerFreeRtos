FreeRTOS port for STM32L152 uC with low power features

This repo show basic project configuration and can be a start point for creating real world application for STM32L1xx based embedded systems.
It also contain high performed configuration for peripherals like I2C, SPI, Flash and USART.

Application can be run on STM32L152Discovery board as well as on custom board with STM32L15x chip,
also can use chips that are in /driver section
